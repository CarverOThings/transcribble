# Transcribble

    > Transcribble is way to save my mother in law time by pipelining the Medical Transcription process through whisper.

    > Openai whisper was chosen for its active development, localization to maintain patient confidentiality, ease of use and it was open source.  

## Explanation of Program
    
    < Transcribble takes audio files and converts into a text file.

    > Currently the program writes to a .txt file with plans of writing to a docx file for ease of manual postprocessing.

    > further plans to add a gui or webgui for UX but for now the user will be placing all the audio files in the input folder, running the program,
    making a coffee, then coming back and validating accuracy for manual postprocessing from the output directory.

## Technical Issues 
    
    > No more! I went all in on a 3080ti that runs the model in record speed.
